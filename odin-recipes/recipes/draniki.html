    <p>These flavorful potato pancakes are starchy and crispy, and will have you saying ‘just one more’ over and over again!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes – 6 medium (700 grams total)</li>
        <li>Egg – 1 medium</li>
        <li>Flour – 3 heaped tablespoons</li>
        <li>Onion – 1 medium white onion</li>
        <li>Salt – 1 tsp</li>
        <li>Pepper – 1/2 tsp</li>
        <li>Sunflower/olive Oil – 4 tbsp</li>
        <li>Garlic, 2-3 cloves, optional</li>
        <li>Fresh Herbs (dill and parsley) – handful, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate the potatoes and add them to a bowl. In the bowl, add 1 tsp of salt, mixing it in. Leave the mixture for around 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the liquid out of the potatoes with your hands or using a cheesecloth, depending on preference.</li>
        <li>With your potato prepared, grate the onion and add it to the drained potatoes.</li>
        <li>Crack open the egg into a separate bowl, beat the egg, and finally add it to the potato-onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Next, add the black pepper and any additional ingredients you’re using, such as minced garlic, dill, and parsley.</li>
        <li>Add the flour to the mixture, and mix everything together thoroughly. Once mixed, you should have a batter similar to pancake batter.</li>
        <li>On a pan, over medium-high heat, add 1 tbsp of oil. When the oil is shimmering, turn the heat down to medium, and add a scoop of batter at a time, forming little potato pancakes. Cook for about 3 minutes on one side until it’s brown on the bottom.</li>
        <li>After about 3 minutes, once the draniki are brown on the bottom, flip them to cook on the other side.</li>
    </ol>
